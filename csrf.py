    """Verifies that the given cross site request forgery token is valid. This
    token is either created by the frontend-web serverside or by the native app.
    In both cases it's possible for third parties to get a valid token: in the
    former case, they can parse the http. In the latter case, they can decompile
    the app. However, both are pretty annoying to do, so it's going to stop all
    but the most dedicated attackers from using an endpoint.

    Used only when we really don't want third parties to use an endpoint, e.g.
    the code endpoint for exchanging an email/password for a code.

    The CSRF is a JWT with the following claims:
    - `iat`: the time the token was issued
    - `exp`: the time the token expires, typically ultra-short for native
      (since it can be created just before the request), but an hour for
      web (where the token is created when the page is opened and requires
      a page refresh to regenerate)
    - `iss`: either `oseh-web` or `oseh-native`; this will determine which
      secret we should use to verify the token
    - `aud`: must be `oseh-direct-account-code`
    - `jti`: a unique identifier for the token; we will deny tokens that
       have been used before. this is primarily to make it easier to void
       attacks that are based on parsing the http responses of the /authorize
       endpoint by e.g. putting it temporarily behind cloudflare.
