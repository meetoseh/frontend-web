/**
 * This uses the component function and the value of the props to
 * render the component.
 *
 * As the name implies, this guards renders: changes to the props will
 * only cause the component to rerender, not the parent (the one rendering
 * this component) to rerender, or the one which created the props
 * to rerender.
 *
 * Since it's often very convenient to lift props creation (e.g., loading
 * images very high up in the state chain so we know whether or not a
 * full-page spinner should be shown), but rerendering high up in the
 * chain is very expensive, this component provides a high-performance
 * way to accomplish both goals: lifted state, restricted rerenders.
