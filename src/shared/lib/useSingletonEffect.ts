/**
 * Acts like useEffect, except the effect is passed an onDone handler which
 * should be called when the effect is done working. Future calls are
 * deduplicated and delayed to ensure the effect is only being run once at a
 * time.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *   For now, destructors are always run immediately after the effect finishes.
 *   This is done just because the effects that want to be singleton generally
 *   aren't manipulating the dom, and hence this is a good enough way to handle
 *   destruction. However, those using this should not rely on that behavior as
 *   it could at some point be changed to be more like useEffect, where it doesn't
 *   get called unless the dependencies change or the component is being unmounted.
 *
 *   What this will guarrantee is that the destructor is always called before the
 *   next effect is run. This will not guarrantee that the destructor is not called
 *   before onDone is called.
 *
 *
 * @param effect The effect-like handler, which is passed an onDone handler
 * @param deps The dependencies for the effect
