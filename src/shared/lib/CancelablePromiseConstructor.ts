/**
 * A constructed cancelable promise is a specific type of cancelable
 * promise implementation, meant to facilitate helper functions that
 * take over the logic of the promise.
 *
 * This essentially lifts the bound variables in the following implementation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const createMyCancelablePromise = (): CancelablePromise<void> => {
 *   let done = false;
 *   let finishing = false;
 *   let rejectCanceled: (() => void) | undefined = undefined;
 *   const cancelers = new Callbacks<undefined>();
 *
 *   // <preamble>
 *
 *   return {
 *     done: () => done,
 *     cancel: () => {
 *       if (!finishing) {
 *        finishing = true;
 *        cancelers.call(undefined);
 *        rejectCanceled?.();
 *       }
 *     },
 *     promise: new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *       if (finishing) {
 *         reject(new Error('canceled'));
 *         return;
 *       }
 *        rejectCanceled = () => reject(new Error('canceled'))
 *
 *       // <body>, which should eventually call resolve or reject
 *     }).finally(() => { done = true; })
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * which would then become
 *
 * ```ts
 * const createMyCancelablePromise = (): CancelablePromise<void> => constructCancelablePromise({
 *   preamble: (state) => {
 *     // state is holding the locals you need, e.g., done, finishing, cancelers
 *   },
 *   body: (state, resolve, reject) => {
 *     // state is holding the locals you need, e.g., done, finishing, cancelers
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Now this allow for helper functions that take over parts (or the entirety) of
 * the preamble or body, without the extensive documentation required to explain
 * what they are allowed to do and how to call them which is more clearly
 * expressed by using a shared implementation which can be referenced
 * (constructCancelablePromise).
 *
 * As can be seen in the above example, the constructor is rarely ever exposed,
 * and thus its existence is primarily to facilitate doucmentation (by means of
 * ensuring implementation consistency)
